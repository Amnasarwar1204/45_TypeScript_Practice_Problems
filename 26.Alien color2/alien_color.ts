// • If the alien’s color is green, print a statement that the player just earned 5 points for shooting the alien.
// • If the alien’s color isn’t green, print a statement that the player just earned 10 points.
// • Write one version of this program that runs the if block and another that runs the else block



// one version of this program that runs the if block

//  create a veriable call alien_color
 let alien_color : string = 'green';

 if(alien_color ==='green'){
console.log("player get 5 points! ");

 }
  else {
   console.log("player get 10 points! ");
  }


// another that runs the else block 
   alien_color  = 'yellow';

  if(alien_color ==='green'){
 console.log("player get 5 points! ");
  }
 else{console.log("player get 10 points! ");
